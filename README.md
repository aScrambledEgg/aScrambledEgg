Hi, I'm Teddy, a High School student in New York! It's nice to meet you!

I'm interested in cooperative agents, like those in https://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/overcooked_ai or applied to the game Hanabi.

I'm very new, but I'm currently participating in my school's Science Research program. 
I'm really excited to spend the next few years learning about this field, in this program and in college.

Currently, I'm looking for a mentor in the field who can help guide my research. If you have some spare time on your hands and feel like helping a high schooler, please reach out!
Don't worry about your geographic location, remote mentorship is totally an option!
Email me at tschwartz542025@gmail.com if you are interested in being my mentor, and please put "GITHUB" in the subject line.

If you want, take a look at the data science project I did with AI Camp! It's very basic, but I loved learning about how to work with data. 
I'll be learning with them in the summer again! If you are interested in you or your child participating in the program, use this link for $100 (USD) off!

I also like hobby 3D printing. I use a Creality Ender 3 V2 and am currently learning OnShape. I'll be making a Thingiverse soon, but currently I don't have any uploads. When I do start it will likely be stupid toys or gadgets. I don't really take 3D printing seriously, its really just a hobby.
